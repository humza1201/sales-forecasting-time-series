Sales Forecasting (Time Series)
Built and evaluated a linear regression forecasting model using lag and rolling features, achieving a 37% MAE reduction over a seasonal naïve baseline, validated through residual analysis.

## what did i build?
“Built a command-line forecasting tool that trains a time-series model and performs recursive multi-step forecasts using rolling historical state.”

## what my model learned?
The linear regression model learned that yearly seasonality is the dominant driver of Walmart sales, as shown by the strong influence of the 52-week lag. Short-term lag and rolling features complemented this by capturing local demand momentum, resulting in a 37% MAE improvement over the seasonal naïve baseline.
